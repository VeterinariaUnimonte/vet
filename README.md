# About
In this work, our group make the process of partially developing a tool that will add benefits such as agility, integrity and modernization to the Veterinary Clinic - Sao Judas. A real project, for a real client, using knowledge acquired through the course of Systems Analysis and Development, based on database fundamentals and web development, using as tools, Visual Studio Code, SQL Server/MYSQL, and the Apache XAAMP or similar.
